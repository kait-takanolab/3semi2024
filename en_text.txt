Artificial intelligence (AI) is an information technology that functions like the human brain. Computers equipped with this technology gain the ability to perceive and think for themselves as if they were human beings. With the power of artificial intelligence, computers think for themselves like humans, which allows them to communicate and interact with people. The concept of artificial technology is so attractive that, even before the technology's invention, people had long imagined this technology as a future dream. Various robots that can communicate and interact with people have appeared in cinemas, novels, and animations.
